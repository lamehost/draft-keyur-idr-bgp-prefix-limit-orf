<abstract>
  <t>
    The BGP specification allows for "the ability to impose an (locally
    configured) upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker
    is willing to accept from a neighbor".  In this specification, we
    define a new Outbound Route Filter type for BGP, termed "Prefix Limit
    Outbound Route Filter", which the speaker can use to communicate that
    upper bound to its peer.  The peer is then required to abide by the
    limit.  This is expected to have benefits in terms of resource
    consumption and more importantly, transparency of operation.
  </t>
</abstract>
</front>
<middle>
<section title="Introduction">
<t>
   The Cooperative Outbound Route Filtering Capability defined in 
   <xref target="RFC5291"/> provides a mechanism for a BGP speaker to send to its BGP
   neighbor a set of Outbound Route Filters (ORFs) that can be used by
   its neighbor to filter its outbound routing updates to the speaker.
</t>

<t>
   This documents defines a new ORF-type for BGP, termed "Prefix Limit
   Outbound Route Filter (PrefixLimit ORF)", that can be used to perform
   Prefix Limit based route filtering. This filtering mechanism imposes
   a limit on a the number of unique prefixes that the BGP speaker can
   advertise to its neighbor.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Prefix Limit ORF-Type">
<t> 
  The Prefix Limit ORF-Type allows a BGP speaker to inform its neighbor
  of its prefix limits.  That is, it provides a mechanism through which
  a BGP speaker can request its neighbor to limit the number of unique
  prefixes that neighbor will advertise to the BGP speaker.
</t>
<t>
  Conceptually a Prefix Limit ORF entry consists of the fields "Action,
  Match, Reserved, Prefix-Limit".
</t>
<t>
<list>
<t>
  Action is a two-bit field.  The definition and use of the Action
  field is described in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Match is a one-bit field.  The value of this field is 0 for PERMIT
   and 1 for DENY.  In the context of the Prefix Limit ORF-Type, DENY
   indicates that the BGP speaker sending the ORF will terminate the
   connection in the event that the Prefix Limit is exceeded.
</t>
<t>
   Reserved is a 5-bit field.  The definition and use of the Reserved
   field is described in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
</t>
<t>
   The "Prefix-Limit" is a four byte unsigned integer. It states the
   maximum number of unique prefixes that the ORF sending BGP speaker is
   willing to accept from the ORF receiving BGP spea
</t>

 </list>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Prefix Limit ORF encoding">
<t>
   The value of the ORF-Type for the Prefix Limit ORF-Type is [TBD].
</t>

<t>
   A Prefix Limit ORF entry is encoded as follows.  The "Action",
   "Match", and the "Reserved" field of the entry is encoded in the
   common part <xref target="RFC5291"/>, and the remaining field of the entry is
   encoded in the "Type specific part" as follows.

<section title="Capability Specification for Cooperative route filtering with Prefix Limit">
<t>

   A BGP speaker signals its compliance with this specification by
   listing the PrefixLimit ORF type in the Cooperative Route Filtering
   Capability as defined in <xref target="RFC5291"></xref>.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Rules for Prefix Limit ORF">
<t>
   We describe the rules for PrefixLimit primarily in terms of the rules
   for the router which sends a PrefixLimit ORF to its peer, which we
   term the "sending speaker", and for the router which receives a
   PrefixLimit ORF from its peer, which we term the "receiving speaker".
   Note that a given router may be either a sending or receiving
   speaker, or both, with respect to any given peering session.
</t>

<t>
   A router which supports PrefixLimit ORF MUST keep track of the number
   of prefixes it has advertised to its peer -- when a new prefix is
   advertised, the count is incremented, and when a prefix is withdrawn,
   the count is decremented.  A modification to the route for an
   already-advertised prefix does not change the count.  We refer to
   this count as the "advertised prefix count" for the session.  In
   effect, the advertised prefix count is equivalent to the size of the
   Adj-RIB-Out for the session.
</t>

<t>
   A router which supports PrefixLimit ORF MAY maintain a received
   prefix count for its peer, which tracks the number of prefixes it has
   accepted from the peer.  In effect, the received route count is
   equivalent to the size of the Adj-RIB-In for the session.  The use of
   such a count is elaborated in the following section.
</t>

<section title="Rules for Sending Speaker">
<t>
   If a BGP speaker (the sending speaker) is configured to bound the
   number of prefixes it is willing to accept from its neighbor, it MAY
   advertise the value of that upper bound to that neighbor using
   PrefixLimit ORF.  In this section and its subsection, when we refer
   to "the PrefixLimit" we are referring to the PrefixLimit value most
   recently advertised by the sending speaker to the receiving speaker.
</t>

<t>
   If the sending speaker does not maintain a received prefix count, it
   is implicitly relying on its peer to correctly abide by this
   specification and no further action is required.  If the sending
   speaker does maintain a received prefix count, it MAY locally enforce
   the PrefixLimit, according to the following rules.
</t>

<section title="Enforcing the Prefix Limit">
<t>
   When the sending speaker sends a PrefixLimit ORF which is less than
   its current received prefix count, it SHOULD wait for some interval
   before enforcing the new PrefixLimit.  The interval to be used is a
   matter of local policy.  Also, even if the PrefixLimit ORF is greater
   than or equal to the current received prefix count, the router may
   wish to wait for some interval before enforcing the new limit in
   order to allow for UPDATEs which may have been in flight prior to the
   receipt of the PrefixLimit ORF by the peer.  Subsequent to any such
   waiting period, the remaining rules in this section SHALL apply.
</t>
<t>
   If the PrefixLimit is exceeded (either because of a route announced
   by the peer or because the peer failed to timely withdraw routes
   after the PrefixLimit is revised downward), the peer is in violation,
   and the sending speaker MAY take corrective action.  The router MAY
   also allow the received prefix count to exceed the PrefixLimit by
   some amount as a matter of local policy.
</t>
<t>
   Corrective actions MAY include dropping the BGP session or refusing
   to accept new prefixes in excess of the PrefixLimit.
</t>
<t>
   If the former option -- dropping the BGP session -- is chosen, the
   router MUST indicate this in advance by advertising its PrefixLimit
   ORF with the Match flag set to DENY.  Also, by default it SHOULD NOT
   automatically reestablish the session.
</t>
<t>
   If the latter option -- refusing to accept new prefixes -- is chosen,
   the router MUST accept modifications to already-accepted prefixes,
   and it MUST accept withdrawals of already-accepted prefixes.  If
   prefixes are withdrawn, the received prefix count will drop below the
   announced PrefixLimit and new prefixes SHOULD be accepted, again up
   to but not exceeding the limit.  Prefixes which are refused MUST
   NOT contribute to the received prefix count.
</t>
<t>
   We note that the option of refusing to accept new prefixes will
   likely lead to desynchronization of the BGP session and is a flawed
   solution at best; operator intervention will be required in order to
   restore synchronization (for example, through correction of routing
   policies and a subsequent route-refresh).
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Rules for Receiving Speaker">
<t>
   When a PrefixLimit ORF is received, the new Prefix Limit value in the
   ORF is considered to be the new maximum Prefix Limit for the
   neighbor.  In this section, when we refer to "the PrefixLimit" we are
   referring to the PrefixLimit value most recently received from the
   sending speaker by the receiving speaker.
</t>
<t>
   If Match field is set to DENY the advertised Prefix-Limit value is
   purely informational and the receiving speaker SHOULD advertise the
   prefix even if doing so would cause its advertised prefix count to
   exceed the Prefix-Limit.
</t>
<t>
  Else, if Match field is set to ALLOW, the receiving speaker MUST NOT
  advertise a prefix to its peer if doing so would cause its advertised
  prefix count to exceed the PrefixLimit.
</t>
<t>
   The receiving speaker MAY take local action when its advertised
   prefix count approaches the PrefixLimit.  The nature of the action
   (logging, etc) is a matter of local policy, as is the threshold at
   which the action occurs.
</t>
<t>
   When the receiving speaker receives a PrefixLimit ORF with When-to-
   Refresh set to DEFER, it need not take any additional action unless
   its current advertised prefix count exceeds the new PrefixLimit.  In
   that case, it MUST take immediate steps to correct the violation.
</t>
<t>
   Such steps MAY include withdrawing already-advertised prefixes so as
   to reduce the advertised prefix count to be less than or equal to the
   PrefixLimit.  The selection of which prefixes to withdraw is a matter
   of local policy.  Another option to correct the violation would be to
   drop the session; in this case the session SHOULD NOT be
   automatically reestablished.
</t>
<t>
   When the receiving speaker receives a PrefixLimit ORF with When-to-
   Refresh set to IMMEDIATE, it behaves as given for DEFER but in
   addition advertises its Adj-RIB-Out as specified in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>
<section title="Error handling">
<t>
ORFs provide information that guides future sending, but any malformed
ORF is simply missed filtering information.  If Prefix Limit ORF is malformed, 
then the Refresh messages shall simply be discarded. 
</t>
</section>
<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues.
However, it does suggest a mechanism by which certain denial of service risks may be reduced.
